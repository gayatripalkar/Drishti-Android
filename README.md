# Drishti - The Android App

An Android app that when connected to a Smart Raspberry Pi activated Walking Stick can lead you to your destination and warn you for the obstacles in the way.
The Smart Stick is for the visually impaired or blind people to be installed in their or their Guardian's android phone.
This App also tracks the stick and if it falls or if 'emergency button' on the stick is pressed an instant message goes to the user's Guardian.
